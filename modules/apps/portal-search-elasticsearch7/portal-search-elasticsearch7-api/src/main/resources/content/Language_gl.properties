additional-index-configurations-help=Enter custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML format (Elasticsearch Create Index API). (Automatic Copy)
additional-type-mappings=Additional Type Mappings (Automatic Copy)
additional-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). This value should be set with new field mappings only. If you set this value with any overlapping mappings for default fields, index creation fails. To replace default mappings entirely, use overrideTypeMappings. (Automatic Copy)
authentication-enabled=Authentication Enabled (Automatic Copy)
authentication-enabled-help=Enable or disable authentication to Elasticsearch with a username and password. (Automatic Copy)
bootstrap-mlockall=Bootstrap Mlockall (Automatic Copy)
bootstrap-mlockall-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. If this is checked, the process address space is locked into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out. (Automatic Copy)

discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port=Zen Discovery Unicast Hosts Port (Automatic Copy)
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Provide a range of ports to use when building the discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts value. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer. (Automatic Copy)
elasticsearch7-configuration-name=Elasticsearch 7 (Automatic Copy)
embedded-http-port=Embedded Http Port (Automatic Copy)
embedded-http-port-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the HTTP port of the embedded Elasticsearch node that is created when Operation Mode is set to EMBEDDED. (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-allow-origin=Http CORS Allow Origin (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-allow-origin-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Enter the origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled. (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-configurations=Http CORS Configurations (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-configurations-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Provide custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml). (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-enabled=Http CORS Enabled (Automatic Copy)
http-cors-enabled-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect. (Automatic Copy)
http-ssl-enabled=Http SSL Enabled (Automatic Copy)
http-ssl-enabled-help=Enable or disable TLS/SSL. This setting is only applied if Authentication Enabled is checked. (Automatic Copy)
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix (Automatic Copy)
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console. (Automatic Copy)
log-exceptions-only=Log Exceptions Only (Automatic Copy)
log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, logs exceptions only from Elasticsearch and does not re-throw them. (Automatic Copy)
network-bind-host=Network Bind Host (Automatic Copy)
network-bind-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Specify the network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests. (Automatic Copy)
network-host=Network Host (Automatic Copy)
network-host-addresses=Network Host Addresses (Automatic Copy)
network-host-addresses-help=Set the remote HTTP hosts to connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to REMOTE. (Automatic Copy)
network-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the hostname or IP address bound to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time. (Automatic Copy)
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host (Automatic Copy)
network-publish-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it. (Automatic Copy)
number-of-index-replicas=Number of Index Replicas (Automatic Copy)
number-of-index-replicas-help=Enter the number of replicas for each Liferay index. If unset, no replicas are used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex. (Automatic Copy)
number-of-index-shards=Number of Index Shards (Automatic Copy)
number-of-index-shards-help=Set the number of shards to use when a Liferay index is created. If unset, a single shard will be used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex. (Automatic Copy)
operation-mode=Operation Mode (Automatic Copy)
operation-mode-help=The REMOTE operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. The EMBEDDED operation mode starts Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. The EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported. (Automatic Copy)
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings (Automatic Copy)
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings. (Automatic Copy)
password-help=If Authentication Enabled is checked, set the password for authenticating to Elasticsearch. (Automatic Copy)
rest-client-logger-level=Rest Client Logger Level (Automatic Copy)
rest-client-logger-level-help=Set the logging level for the Elasticsearch REST client. (Automatic Copy)
transport-tcp-port=Transport TCP Port (Automatic Copy)
